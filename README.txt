 My project is the start of a quality management system (my plan is to continue working on it during the next cohort).  I currently work in manufacturing and we currently heavily rely on excel spreadsheets for all of our support roles at my job.  These often get lost or are not revised to the new standards.  This program is going to help automate and keep us more organized by putting everything in one place and much more user friendly.  

The features that I used on my list are 

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program. – This is created to run the user interface command prompts.

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program. --  This is created to record the spare parts list for each machine.

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application – this was created to pull the list of assemblies from the csv file.

Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams) – this was done to convert the amount of hose length that is taken from the user in standard inches and given back to them in meters.  

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) – this is used to take the date in which the hose was put on the machine and calculate 90 days from that date.  This is a requirement (Hoses must be replaced every 90 days) that is given by the manufacturer.
